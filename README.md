## Greenden Plant Website

I’ve built a **plant-selling website** called **Greenden** using **HTML and Tailwind CSS**. It’s a clean and minimal website that allows users to explore different plants, check their prices, and get in touch with us.  

## Project Overview  
Greenden is a simple yet elegant **online plant store** designed for plant lovers. The website is fully responsive and ensures a smooth browsing experience. This website is fully responsive in all devices(mobile,tablets and laptop).

It consists of **three main pages**:  

### 1. Home Page  
- Introduces visitors to **Greenden** through an **About section**.  
- Showcases **customer reviews** to build trust.  
- Displays **bestselling plants** with attractive visuals.
- Newsletter subscription for exclusive updates.  

### 2. Product Page  
- Contains a variety of **plants** with their **names and prices**.  
- Clean grid layout for easy navigation.  

### 3. Contact Page  
- A **contact form** that allows users to reach out for queries or orders.  
- Simple and user-friendly design.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML:** For structuring the web pages.  
- **Tailwind CSS:**  For modern, responsive, and fast styling.
